# Fire Control

## High level description of the project

As climate change has more and more of an effect in the world. Our natural environments become drier, especially in the mediteranean climate. This leads to fires being more and more dangerous every year. While forest-fires are rare in nature it only takes one to completely ravage an entire eco-system. Early detection and action is therefore key to prevent them from becoming untamable. This is why we propose to build a network of sophisticated cameras that will monitor the eco-system to better help detect and prevent wild-fires.

In our system we envision a set of cameras all connected to a central sentry that would monitor and detect potential fires and alert accordingly. These thermal cameras will be powered by a detecion machine learning model using Computer Vision.

### What we aim to use

#### Singular sentry
| Components | Use case | Price (CHF) |
| :---| :---| :---|
| Thermal cameras | Fire detection unit | |
| Long range distance sensor | Location of fire in GPS | |
| Solar Panels | Keeps the sentry working | |
| LithiumPolymer Batteries | Supply current cameras | | 
| Arduino | Comunicates video feed to database | |

**Insight Robotics**:
Insight Robotics specializes in wildfire detection and monitoring solutions. They use thermal imaging and AI to detect fires early. Their system includes ground-based sensors and can integrate aerial imagery from drones for comprehensive monitoring and rapid response.

**Pano AI**:
Pano AIâ€™s approach involves using AI-powered cameras mounted on high vantage points to detect smoke and fire. Their system can pinpoint the location of a fire, allowing for quick dispatch of firefighting resources. The use of drones for live streaming and further assessment could complement their existing infrastructure.


## User stories

The end user is aimed at forest fire guards and private forest owners that would want to be able to monitor and protect their land.

They will be equiped with an app that will give them a live feed of the cameras and give them the exact geo-location of the fire.
