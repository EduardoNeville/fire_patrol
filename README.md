# Fire Patrol

## What are we?

We are a student lead project with the objective of helping prevent wildfires in the world.

The project is divided between two courses taught at EPFL; Making Inteligent Things and Software Enterprise.

## What are our objectives?

1. Detect wildfires earlier with continuous monitoring
Perform video feeds autonomously. Human intervention is only needed to verify low confidence threats and ensure the proper response.

2. Easily scale detection capabilities
Monitor hundreds or thousands of existing fire surveillance cameras simultaneously. Easily scale fire and smoke detection capabilities to address growing wildfire incidents.

3. Act faster with pre-programmed response protocols
We determine the nature of a smoke and fire threat and sends real-time alerts to the appropriate departments, for faster emergency responses with the right equipment and personnel.

4. Increase detection accuracy
Instantly detect the most subtle indications of smoke and fire in any camera stream, all in a fraction of the time even a well-trained human eye â€¯could notice there might be a threat.

5. Improve personnel productivity
Using AI Vision for monitoring terrain anomalies and use your experienced personnel for verification and deploying responses.

## Making Inteligent Things project

In this project we will develop the tools for early detection. A network of autonomous sentries that will monitor the environment and stream the data back to the main database. Each sentry will be equiped with a set of tools to detect and comunicate potential fires being found.
