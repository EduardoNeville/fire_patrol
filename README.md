1. Detect wildfires earlier with continuous monitoring
Perform video feeds autonomously. Human intervention is only needed to verify low confidence threats and ensure the proper response.

2. Easily scale detection capabilities
Monitor hundreds or thousands of existing fire surveillance cameras simultaneously. Easily scale fire and smoke detection capabilities to address growing wildfire incidents.

3. Act faster with pre-programmed response protocols
