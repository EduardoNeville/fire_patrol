## Rough list of things to think about 

- [ ] Detection of fire from images, both infrared and actual image
- [ ] Optimize layout to create the best drone/area coverage of a specific area
- [ ] Best drone to use

## How it'll work 

1. Set up stations scattered around the forest in a way that optimizes drone/area ratio
2. Drones patrol their respective areas with optimzed routes to have best coverage
3. Each "Scout" drone is equipped with infrared camera and regular camera to detect fire 
4. Use ML algorithm to detect fire
5. If detected fire drone send alert and extinguisher drone is sent from closest post.
6. If not enough. Call firefighters. 

### Drones 

#### Scout

Just patrols the requested area in search for potential fires <br> 
Is equiped with camera and sends live feed to the central station where al drones information is managed

#### Extinguisher

Is placed in every post so as to be as close to the point of fire as possible
Once there it extinguises the fire.
